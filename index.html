                    This <b>Bubble Plot</b> provides a visualisation of unemployment rates across different regions. Each bubble represents a region, and the size of the bubble correlates with the region's unemployment rate. Larger bubbles indicate higher unemployment rates, making it easier to identify regions that face more significant unemployment challenges.

                    <b>Sabah</b> stands out with the largest unemployment rate at <b><i>7.9%</i></b>, making it the region with the most severe unemployment issues. On the other hand, despite having the largest population, <b>Selangor</b> maintains a relatively low unemployment rate of <b><i>2%</i></b>, which is comparable to <b>Perlis</b>, also at <b>2%</b>. Interestingly, <b>Kedah</b> has one of the lowest unemployment rates, standing at <b><i>1.9%</i></b>, highlighting that some regions with fewer people may still achieve lower unemployment rates.

                    The <b>Radial Chart</b> provides a clear visualisation of the top 10 countries with the highest unemployment rates. Each segment corresponds to a specific country, with its size representing the unemployment rate for the selected sex. The chart allows users to easily compare unemployment rates between men and women by switching the selection using the dropdown below the chart.

                <p class="description">
                    A key insight from the chart is that both <b><i>males and females</i></b> hold the highest unemployment rates in <b><i>Djibouti</i></b>, underscoring significant gender-neutral economic challenges in the country. The colour-coded segments, explained in the legend, help to quickly identify countries with similar rates.

                    Over the years, <b><i>female unemployment</i></b> has been consistently higher than male unemployment, particularly among younger age groups (15-24). This may be due to gender disparities in certain industries and societal expectations, such as caregiving responsibilities, which can affect womenâ€™s participation in the workforce.
